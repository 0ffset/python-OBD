# OBD Commands

---

An `OBDCommand` is an object used to query information from the vehicle. They contain all of the information neccessary to perform the query, and decode the cars response. Python-OBD has built in tables for the most common commands. They can be looked up by name, or by mode/PID (for a full list, see [Command Tables](https://github.com/brendanwhitfield/python-OBD/wiki/Command-Tables)).

```python
import obd

c = obd.commands.RPM

# OR

c = obd.commands['RPM']

# OR

c = obd.commands[1][12] # mode 1, PID 12 (RPM)
```

# Methods

## has_command(command)

```
